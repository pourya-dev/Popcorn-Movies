Overview üìù
This project is an intelligent Telegram Bot designed for a comprehensive movie discovery experience. It integrates a vast movie database, created through a multi-stage scraping pipeline, with a machine learning engine to offer users two powerful ways to find movies:

Movie Information Retrieval: Users can search for any movie title to get detailed information.

Intelligent Recommendations:

Movie-to-Movie: Get recommendations for movies similar to a specific title.

Keyword-Based: Discover movies using keywords like genre, country of origin, or actor/director names.

Features ‚ú®
‚ú® Powerful Inline Mode: Search for movies and get recommendations directly from any chat without having to talk to the bot directly.

üí¨ Conversational Discovery: A guided "Discover" mode that prompts you for keywords and delivers tailored results.

‚ù§Ô∏è Favorites Management: Add, view, and delete your favorite movies, which are saved to your user account.

üöÄ Deep Linking: Recommendation messages contain clickable links that take you directly to the movie's information page within the bot.

üß† Modular & Resilient Architecture: The project is built with a clear separation of concerns, from the fault-tolerant data scrapers to the object-oriented recommendation engine.

Project Architecture üèõÔ∏è
The project is divided into three main components, each with its own set of scripts:

Data Scraping Pipeline:

wiki_extractor.py: A lightweight scraper to generate a list of movie titles from Wikipedia.

Scraper.py: A robust, stateful API scraper that enriches the title list with detailed data from the OMDb API. It features automatic API key rotation and graceful shutdown.

Machine Learning Engine:

engine.py: An object-oriented, content-based recommendation engine. It uses scikit-learn and Pandas to perform TF-IDF vectorization and calculate cosine similarity between movies based on their features (genre, director, actors, etc.).

The Telegram Bot:

bot.py: The main application that integrates all components and handles user interactions.

Explorer.py: A helper module for loading and searching the scraped movie data from memory.

user_management.py: An object-oriented module for creating and managing persistent user data (like favorites) in a CSV file.

bot_logger.py: A simple utility for logging bot activity to the console and a bot.log file.

Setup and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher

Git

2. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
3. Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
Create a file named requirements.txt with the following content:

requests
beautifulsoup4
pandas
scikit-learn
selenium
webdriver-manager
python-telegram-bot
tqdm
numpy
scipy
Then, install the libraries using pip:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Configure the Bot
Get a Telegram Bot Token: Talk to @BotFather on Telegram to create a new bot and get your unique token.

Edit bot.py: Open the bot.py file and replace "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN_HERE" with the actual token you received.

Prepare API Keys: Create a file named api_keys.txt and add your OMDb API keys, one per line.

Prepare Data Files: Ensure you have your initial movie data file (e.g., movies.csv) in the root directory for the ML engine to use.

Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Build the Database (if needed):

Run the wiki_extractor.py to generate the initial movie_titles.txt.

Run the Scraper.py to process this list and generate the final Extdata.txt database.

Run the Bot:

Once your configuration is complete, start the bot by running the main script:

Bash

python bot.py
The bot will print a startup message and will begin polling for updates from Telegram.

Interact with the Bot on Telegram:

Find your bot on Telegram and send the /start command to see the main menu.

Use the inline mode (@your_bot_username movie title) in any chat to search for movies or get recommendations.
